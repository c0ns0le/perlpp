Text-PerlPP - a Perl preprocessor

Translates text files with embedded Perl code to plain text files.
See README.md for details.  A simple example:

    <? my $x = 42; ?><?! echo Hello, World! ?><?= $x ?>

will output

    Hello, World!
    42

<? ... ?> is a Perl code chunk, <?! ... ?> runs an external command, and
<?= ... ?> prints a Perl expression.  There are more commands, listed in
README.md.

REQUIRES

Perl 5.10+ and Getopt::Long 2.50.  There is a fatpacked version that
already includes Getopt::Long in the GitHub releases archive:
https://github.com/interpreters/perlpp/releases

INSTALLATION

Easy installation, using App::cpanminus:

    cpanm Text::PerlPP

Easy installation, using the release from GitHub:

    - Copy the release file to a directory in your PATH

Slightly less easy installation, using ExtUtils::MakeMaker:

    - Unpack the tarball
    - In the resulting directory, run the following commands:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

Yet another alternative way of installing

    - Copy lib/Text/PerlPP.pm to a directory in your @INC
    - Copy bin/perlpp to a directory in your PATH.
